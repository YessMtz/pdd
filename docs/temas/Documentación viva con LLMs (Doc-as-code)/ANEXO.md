# 📎 Appendix: Prompts & Ethical Reflection (Aligned with AI Usage Guidance)

## 1️⃣ Prompts Used

These are the main prompts applied while creating the **Living Documentation with LLMs (Doc-as-code)** README:

- “Generate a complete and visually appealing README.md about ‘Documentación viva con LLMs (Doc-as-code)’ including introduction, examples, links to refactoring, quality, design patterns.”
- “Create a Markdown file including an ethical reflection and APA references, deposit them for the teacher with page numbers in English (20%).”
- “List practical examples and relate them to refactoring and design patterns.”

> All prompts were documented to comply with the **Transparency** recommendation in the AI usage guide.

## 2️⃣ Ethical Reflection

> Using AI responsibly is fundamental.  
> According to the course’s **AI Usage Guide**, students must use LLMs as a support for learning, never as a replacement for reasoning or personal effort.  
> Large Language Models empower us to generate and update documentation dynamically, but we must validate and adapt the output.  
> Ethical use implies clarity on what was AI-assisted, careful verification, and acknowledgment of sources.

Recommendations based on the guide:
- ✅ Transparency: Always mention which content was assisted by AI.
- ✅ Critique: Test and refine outputs instead of copying blindly.
- ✅ Active learning: Treat AI as a mentor, not as a shortcut.
- 🚫 Do not present AI-generated solutions as fully your own without comprehension.
